# Manufacturing-Process-Modeling

This repository simulates a real world process phenomenon with Gaussian regression and explore overfitting solution by L1/L2 regularization.

The application is built with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) and the regression code refers from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html).
